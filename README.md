# 🚀 Face Recognition Brain

## 💡 What was developed
In this project we developed an application in which the user can send a url of a image that contains a person and the backend, using Clarifai API, returns the position of a face in the image. So basically, the user can register in the website (the user information is stored in a PostgreSQL database) and when the registered user makes a request from the database, the number os "requests" it's updated, showing a sort of a "ranking system". Since the project it's from a Complete Web Developer Course, it's simple but it uses React, Node and PostgreSQL and a lot of concepts of Web Development were used in the project.

## 💻 Technologies 
* _Back-End_: **NodeJS**
* _Front-End Web_: **ReactJS**
* _DataBase_: **PostgreSQL**

## 📂 Otehr technologies
* Back-End: Express, Cors, Clarifai, KNEX, PostgreSQL e BCrypt and others;
* Front-End Web: Clarifai, Tachyons and others;

## 👨‍💻 My experience
This was my first big project in Web Development, isn't original, but it I've tried to customize and implement a few things differently from the course. And my experience with the project was absolutely HUGE. I've learned a lot of key features from the basics in Web Development to advanced concepts in React and Node. I felt so awesome and the end of the project, showed everyone the result of the project. So, to my experience in Web Development it was a big step! The whole course it's perfect (if you want to know, the name of the course is "The Complete Web Development in 2020: Zero to Mastery" on Udemy) and I'm really proud of finishing it! =)
